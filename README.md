# __Switch Custom Game Icons__

*Using **sys-tweak** on atmosphere simply put icons in the right content folder ie: atmosphere/contents/[TITLEIDHERE]/icon.jpg*
or download the zip from this repo and extract it to the root of your SD card

## This repo is just a back up for icons I've made using the guide from [gbatemp:video_game:](https://gbatemp.net/threads/custom-game-icons-tutorial-and-sharing-hub-no-forwarders.574675/)

*:construction:I'm still tring to figure out github I've never really attempted to use it before, 
so hopfully my markdown improves and these icons are easily to navigate.
failing that clone the repo? :stop_sign:
